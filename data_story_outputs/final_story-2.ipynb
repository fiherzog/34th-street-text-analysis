    "## Introduction\n",
    "If you haven’t read 34th Street Magazine, where have you been? (Seriously, go pick up an issue in Anneberg right now.) Both authors write for 34th Street Magazine, and we were interested in looking more at the past articles for the publication we both contribute to. \n",
    "\n",
    "From an initial read through of some older issues, we realized the overall tone and direction of the magazine have shifted significantly in the past few years. In 2020, features included titles such as “‘Zoomed Out,’ ‘Lonely,’ and ‘Tired’: Hours online with little social interaction wear on Penn students” and “‘You Can’t Not Take That Home’: Penn Nurses on the Emotional Toll of Coronavirus”. These articles differed significantly in the topics covered by more recent features, encouraging us to look deeper into what other trends could be uncovered through computational analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, 34th Street is a student magazine, written, edited, and published entirely by Penn undergraduates. While the writers for 34th Street only account for a small group of viewpoints, the topics and attitudes reflected in their writing can serve as a lens to investigate what’s important and salient to the broader student population. \n",
    "This analysis looks at the corpus of 34th Street articles since 2020. Using Frequency/N-gram Analysis, Key Word In Context, Sentiment Analysis, and Topic Modeling, we will be looking at how articles in 34th Street have changed over time, using mental health as a key theme to direct research. \n",

    "## Research Question\n",
    "How have themes such as mental health and well-being been portrayed in 34th Street since COVID and how have these narratives changed over time?\n",

    "The monthly plot of mental health-related articles reveals some key trends tied to the academic calendar. Spikes in article counts are observed around the start of each school semester, particularly in the months of September to December and February to April, which suggests that as students return to school and face academic challenges, mental health topics become more prominent in discussions. This aligns with the natural rhythms of student life, where periods of high academic stress might lead to more articles being written.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the overall decline in the number of mental health-related articles over time is notable. This dip, especially post-pandemic, could indicate that students are facing fewer mental health challenges compared to the height of the pandemic. This pattern could suggest that students are shifting their focus to other aspects of their lives and studies, leading to a decrease in a desire to cover mental health struggles, and instead more variety in content."

Thus, we can attribute the high frequency of mental health articles in 2021 as a negative, where many writers were expressing dissatisfaction. We suppose this is in response to COVID, where many writers were unable to enjoy the college lives they were promised while being locked in close proximity with their families, partners, etc. However, from this chart, we can then see that as the years passed, even though there were still mental health articles written, the overall sentiment increased, indicating that the conversation surrounding mental health became more varied and not just strictly discussing poor mental health.

    "**Categorizing the Topics**\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above keywords, these topics can be categorized into the following approximate categories\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Race, Social Justice, and Pandemic\n",
    "2. Personal Experiences and Reflections\n",
    "3. Film and TV\n",
    "4. Music\n",
    "5. Art, Social Media, and Beauty Standards\n",
    "6. University Experience\n",
    "7. Food and Culture\n",
    "\n",
    "The first category is likely tied to specific global events, and the second category is likely tied to personal reflections and events that may cause stress. The next few topics tie specifically into sections: Film & TV, Music, Arts, and Style (which is meant to focus on University life and the student experience). Even the first two topics may align with sections. Both the Features and Focus section are geared towards covering current events, and the Word on the Street section covers personal essays from writers - aligning with topic 2. Topic 7 is mostly about food and restaurants: while not tied to a specific section, 34th Street publishes a dining guide full of restaurant reviews and food related content every year, which may explain it's prevalence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, it seems the topics mostly align with the sections of the magazine. This is really interesting, as it shows that article subject matter is definitively corralled by the section groups that have been set out by the magazine. Whether or not those pre-determined sections are comprehensive or exhaustive is up for debate, but seem to capture many of the predicted key-words identified earlier. For example \"pandemic\" and \"police\" are two large stressors key to 2020. Additionally, the n-gram analysis from before predicted social media to be largely associated with our mental health key words, and words like \"instagram\" and \"tiktok\" appear frequently across the topic areas.

    "After plotting the distribution of these topics over time, a couple interesting trends emerge. First, Personal Experience and Reflections are routinely the top category. These key words likely appear in a broad range of articles in relation to student's personal experiences. \n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the Race, Social Justice and Pandemic Category was the second highest during 2021, with a steep drop off the following year. These key words related to global events are tied directly to that time period, but continue to be important afterwards. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last category is Art, Social Media, and Beauty Standards, which has risen to be the 2nd most common topic area in 2021 and 3rd after 2023. This demonstrates a change in what is likely causing mental health conflicts with students, as social media continues to emerge as a recurring trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, Film and TV consistently appears to be the second most common, which is interesting, although not immediately explainable. The rest of the categories have relatively consistent frequencies with varying prevalence. "

    "The examination of 34th Street Magazine's coverage of mental health since the onset of COVID-19 reveals a fascinating evolution in themes, sentiments, and approaches over the years. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mental health-related articles peaked in 2021, correlating with pandemic challenges, before gradually declining. \n",
    "\n",
    "Early pandemic coverage (2020-2021) was dominated by themes of personal struggle, social isolation, and the pervasive impact of social media. Post-2021, the narrative broadened to explore systemic challenges, societal reforms, and diverse factors influencing mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial sentiment skewed towards negativity, reflecting the toll of the pandemic. Over time, articles adopted more positive and neutral tones, focusing on recovery, advocacy, and constructive discussions about mental health and well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the diversification of topics, recurring elements such as \"high school\" and \"social media\" highlight ongoing concerns about youth mental health and digital influences. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, 34th Street Magazine's exploration of mental health has transitioned from immediate, reactive coverage during the pandemic to a more sustained, nuanced engagement with the topic. This progression mirrors broader societal trends, where the dialogue around mental health has shifted from crisis response to a more nuanced understanding that recognizes the vast and complex scope of factors contributing to mental health struggles."
