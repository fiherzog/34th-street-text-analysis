# Analyzing Mental Health in 34th Street Magazine - Andrew Lu and Fiona Herzog
## Group project for COMM3130 _Computational Text Analysis for Communication Research_ (Fall 2024)

If you haven’t read 34th Street Magazine, where have you been? (Seriously, go pick up an issue in Anneberg right now.) Both authors write for 34th Street Magazine, and we were interested in looking more at the past articles for the publication we both contribute to. 

From an initial read through of some older issues, we realized the overall tone and direction of the magazine have shifted significantly in the past few years. In 2020, features included titles such as “‘Zoomed Out,’ ‘Lonely,’ and ‘Tired’: Hours online with little social interaction wear on Penn students” and “‘You Can’t Not Take That Home’: Penn Nurses on the Emotional Toll of Coronavirus”. These articles differed significantly in the topics covered by more recent features, encouraging us to look deeper into what other trends could be uncovered through computational analysis. 

Crucially, 34th Street is a student magazine, written, edited, and published entirely by Penn undergraduates. While the writers for 34th Street only account for a small group of viewpoints, the topics and attitudes reflected in their writing can serve as a lens to investigate what’s important and salient to the broader student population. 

This analysis looks at the corpus of 34th Street articles since 2020, given to us by the data department within the Daily Pennsylvanian. Using Frequency/N-gram Analysis, Key Word In Context, Sentiment Analysis, and Topic Modeling, we will be looking at how articles in 34th Street have changed over time, using mental health as a key theme to direct research.

Our project is divided into the following folders: 

## data folder
* This is a folder containing our data

## data_analysis folder
* This is a folder containing the cleaned and analyzed data.
* We performed the cleaning and analyzing across multiple steps.

## data_story_outputs folder
* This folder contains our data story complete with visualizations in a magazine format and a blog post

## presentations folder
* This folder contains the iterations of our initial presentation up to our final presentation


Our findings are best summarized in the data_story_outputs folder, but feel free to explore however you like!
